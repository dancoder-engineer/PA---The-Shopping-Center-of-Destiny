# How to make a game with this

All the data for the game itself lives in gamedata.js, where it's an object called `const gameData = { }`


##Metadata

Immediately below this is a metadata object

```
    "metadata": {
        "title": "Game Title",
        "inventory": true
    },
```

Tht title is the title of your game, while the inventory tells the game whether or not you want to show the player their inventory. Technically it'll be there under the hood regardless, but if your game doesn't use an inventory, why bother taking up space with it?


###Main Data

Under the metadata object goes the main data object

```

"mainData": {

            "inventory": ["pencil", "phone", "book", "tv"],

            ...labels
        },

```

The inventory is an array of the names of strings representing the inventory items the player can have.

##Labels

Because this system is emulating QBasic text adventures where the entire gameplay is choosing an option and going to a different choice based on what the player chose,
this engine runs on labels, just like you would GOTO in QBasic. These live in the mainData, right under the inventory, an example is as follows.

```
"0": {
            "text": "Game Title",
            "options": ["Start"],
            "labels": ["50"],
            "commands": ["Stop Audio"]
    }
```


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
